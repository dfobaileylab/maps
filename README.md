# Geographical Layers Related to Ballast Water Treatment and Exchange

Here we prepared a few geographical layers related to ballast water treatment and exchange in raster and vector format.

## Bathymetry

This layer shows the depth of ocean for two important threshold that is related to ballast water treatment and exchange. The data sourced to [natural earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) which created from  [NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM Plus)](https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/). 

### Bathymetry with depth of 2000meter

There are two formats of data available for this layer both are included in the `bathymetry_2000m` folder.  
The shape file includes all files starting with `ne_10m`. The raster file generated for this layer is in the raster folder. [bathymetry 2000 m](https://github.com/dfobaileylab/maps/blob/main/bathymetry_2000m/raster/Bathy2000mDepth.zip). This file includes two resolutions for this layer: each pixel is about 100 meter (for calculations), each pixel is about 2000 meters (for visualization)
